# Leaf Disease-segmentation
This repo is of segmentation and morphological operations which are the basic concepts of image processing. Detection and extraction of disease from images of the leaf is done using python
seg py

**METHODOLOGY**: 
 
The algorithm has two stages, first is pre-processing of given image and after that segmentation and then perform morphological operations. Steps of algorithm are as following:-  
1) Give image of leaf as input. 
2) Convert it to gray scale image. 
3) Compute threshold segmentation.  
4) Compute watershed segmentation.  
5) Compute morphological operation. 
6) Finally output will be a leaf region.
